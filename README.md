# vue-web-bluetooth-arduino-starter

A nice starting point for a PWA that talks to an arduino.
Opens up a way to use a standby phone as a gui for multiple hobby, home and security devices.

Maybe software isn't eating the whole world, but it certainly is gobbling up physical dials and switches!!

Based heavily off of the vanilla [WebBluetooth-Terminal](https://github.com/hewittwill/WebBluetooth-Terminal).
